App only supports limited commands becasue I decided to do some manual parsing for practice. 

If I had chosen to use the redis default error checks through replies, it would've been easier but I wanted to just practice the string parseing/tokenizing etc

Have fun :D 

supports:
- set
- get 
- del
- ttl
- setex
- expire
- and if you type exit, it'll exit the app
